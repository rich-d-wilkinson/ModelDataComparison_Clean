## Model data comparison in python

To use this code, you will need to install various python packages such as numpy and matplotlib. To use the notebooks, you'll need Jupyter. The easiest way of getting these things is to install a python installation from [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).

You will also need to install [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy).

Ideally, you will also install [Basemaps](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/), but this is a bit of a faff. I'm working on plotting that doesn't rely on basemaps. Currently, most of the code in [Demonstration_brief](notebooks/Demonstration_brief.ipynb) works without basemaps. I've not had time to update the other pars.

Once you have done the installation, then its best to clone this repository, and play with the notebooks. The data for the notebooks is provided as part of the repo.
